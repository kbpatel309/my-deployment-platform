# My Deployment Platform

Learning how deployment platforms like Vercel/Netlify work by building a simplified version.

## What I'm Building

A system that can:

- Clone a GitHub repository
- Install dependencies
- Build the project
- Serve it on a URL

## Progress

- [x] Day 1: Manual deployment process
- [ ] Day 2: Python automation script
- [ ] Day 3: Web interface
- [ ] Day 4: Serve multiple projects

## Tech Stack

- Python (automation)
- Next.js (test deployments)
- Node.js (serving)

## Why This Project?

I'm learning the internals of deployment platforms to understand DevOps and CI/CD concepts.
