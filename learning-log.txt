What I just did: Cloned a GitHub repo (my ListAI project) using git clone
Why: I need the code on my computer to build it
What I learned: git clone [paste-the-url-you-copied] [name-of-folder-you-want-to-have-cloned-repo]
Problems I hit: None

What I just did: Ran npm install
Why: Downloads all the libraries/packages the project needs
What I learned: "npm install" command downloads and installs packages (also known as modules or libraries) and their dependencies,
making them available for use within a project. Some things npm install does is:
    * Reads package.json: When executed in a directory that has package.json file, npm install reads the file to identify the
      project's declared dependencies, which are listed under dependencies and devDependecies.
    * Consults package-lock.json: If this file exists, the command uses it to ensure the exact versions of the packages previously
      installed are re-installed, promoting consistency across different environments.
    * Downloads packages: It fetches the required packages and their respective dependencies from npm registry.
    * Creates node_modules folder: The downloaded packages are placed in this folder within the project directory. The folder has
      all the necessary code for the project's dependencies.
    * Handles dependencies recursively: If a package itself has dependencies, npm install recursively downloads and installs those.
Problems I hit: None

What I just did: Ran npm run build
Why: Converts the source code into files a browser can understand
Problem: Build failed because the app needs a Convex url
What I learned: Some apps need environment variables (API keys, URLs) to build
Real insight: Deployment platforms like Vercel handle this with environment variable settings

=== DAY 1 COMPLETED ===

What I accomplished:
- Cloned a repo (first one had external dependencies, learned about environment variables)
- Created a fresh Next.js app using create-next-app
- Successfully ran npm install
- Successfully ran npm run build
- Served it locally and viewed it in browser

What was hardest:
- Hardest thing was the Convex error. All I saw was that there was an error related to Convex (my ListAI project) and had to use a new app

What I still don't understand:
- How to read the error related to Convex
