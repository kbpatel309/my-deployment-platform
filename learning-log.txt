=== DAY 1 START ===

What I just did: Cloned a GitHub repo (my ListAI project) using git clone
Why: I need the code on my computer to build it
What I learned: git clone [paste-the-url-you-copied] [name-of-folder-you-want-to-have-cloned-repo]
Problems I hit: None

What I just did: Ran npm install
Why: Downloads all the libraries/packages the project needs
What I learned: "npm install" command downloads and installs packages (also known as modules or libraries) and their dependencies,
making them available for use within a project. Some things npm install does is:
    * Reads package.json: When executed in a directory that has package.json file, npm install reads the file to identify the
      project's declared dependencies, which are listed under dependencies and devDependecies.
    * Consults package-lock.json: If this file exists, the command uses it to ensure the exact versions of the packages previously
      installed are re-installed, promoting consistency across different environments.
    * Downloads packages: It fetches the required packages and their respective dependencies from npm registry.
    * Creates node_modules folder: The downloaded packages are placed in this folder within the project directory. The folder has
      all the necessary code for the project's dependencies.
    * Handles dependencies recursively: If a package itself has dependencies, npm install recursively downloads and installs those.
Problems I hit: None

What I just did: Ran npm run build
Why: Converts the source code into files a browser can understand
Problem: Build failed because the app needs a Convex url
What I learned: Some apps need environment variables (API keys, URLs) to build
Real insight: Deployment platforms like Vercel handle this with environment variable settings

=== DAY 1 COMPLETED ===

What I accomplished:
- Cloned a repo (first one had external dependencies, learned about environment variables)
- Created a fresh Next.js app using create-next-app
- Successfully ran npm install
- Successfully ran npm run build
- Served it locally and viewed it in browser

What was hardest:
- Hardest thing was the Convex error. All I saw was that there was an error related to Convex (my ListAI project) and had to use a new app

What I still don't understand:
- How to read the error related to Convex

=== DAY 2 START ===

Pomodoro 1 done - creating file and test python.
What I did: Created deploy.py function and made a function that accepts a URLs
What I learned: Learned f-string (or formatted string literal) is Python way to embed expressions in string literal
Problems: None

Pomodoro 2 done - make it clone repo.
What I did: Made the Python script actually clone a repo
What I learned: os module allows you to perform various operations related to operating system
os.system() runs terminal commands from Python
os.path module is able to interact with file and directory paths throughout different operating systems
os.makedirs() allows you to create directories recursively, meaning can create intermediate directories that don't exist along with final target directory
Problems: - Learned that huge repos (2GB+) can cause issues
- Windows has filename length limits
- Removed first test project and switched to smaller test project (leerob/leerob.io)

Pomodoro 3 - installed dependencies.
What I did:
- Added npm install to my deploy.py script
- First attempt failed due to dependency conflicts in the repo
- Added --legacy-peer-deps flag to handle conflicts
- Successfully cloned and installed dependencies for a real Next.js project (1088 packages!)

What I learned:
- os.chdir() changes the working directory so commands run in the right folder
- Not all repos on GitHub have working dependencies (even popular ones)
- Real deployment platforms need to handle dependency conflicts
- --legacy-peer-deps is a way to bypass peer dependency issues
- npm install can take 2+ minutes for large projects
- Warnings about deprecated packages are normal and don't break builds

What worked:
- My script correctly cloned a 14MB repo
- Dependencies installed successfully with the workaround
- Script is now ready for final step: building

Problems I hit:
- Initial repo (Vercel Next.js) was too massive (2GB)
- Second repo (shadcn taxonomy) had dependency conflicts
- Fixed with --legacy-peer-deps flag

Pomodoro 4 - run npm build.
What I did:
- Added npm run build to complete the automation
- Script successfully: cloned repo, installed 1088 packages, ran build
- Build failed due to repo-specific issues (Contentlayer + Windows)
- Learned that not every repo builds successfully even with correct automation

What I learned:
- My script works correctly - it automated the entire deployment pipeline
- Some repos have platform-specific issues (Windows vs Mac/Linux)
- Real deployment platforms encounter these same issues
- Error handling is important - my script detected and reported the failure
- The automation is complete even if individual repos fail

Key insight:
The goal wasn't to build EVERY repo successfully. The goal was to automate the PROCESS. I did that. Vercel would also fail on this repo without proper config.

What worked:
✅ Clone automation
✅ Dependency installation automation  
✅ Build command execution
✅ Error detection and reporting

=== DAY 2 ACHIEVEMENT ===
I have a fully automated deployment script that:
- Takes any GitHub URL
- Clones it
- Installs dependencies
- Builds it
- Reports results

I just deployed a Next.js app (test-deployment) using automation I wrote.
My Python script:
- Installed dependencies
- Built the production files
- Started the server
All with one command python deploy.py
